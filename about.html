				<h1>About Lana</h1>
				<h5>Actress<span> & Singer</span></h5>
				<p>They use to call her DN, which stood for Deadly Nightshade, cause she was filled with poison but blessed with beauty and rage. Jim told her that.
					<br>She never wanted to lead a normal life. She's also exceptionally beautiful: the cascading, Auburn hair, those blown-out lips, the thick kohl-dipped lashes.
					<br> Not only got a passion for singing, but she loves to be in the middle of a long writing melody process. "I like to write things that I especially loved, that were just perfectly tailored me"
					<br>
					<br> Del Rey calls her hobby "stranger searching". She adds: "it's still my passion. I would just walk out of my front door in Brookly or Manhattan to meet somebody who has the same energy"
					<br> Aside from being a role model herself, Lana also told that she admired Bob Dylan, Sinatra, Elvis Prasley and Nirvana as her biggest inspirations. She admitted, "I just like the masters of every genre"
					<br> Lana often said, "Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not but at best I can say I'm not sad". And that's how we called it as a motivation</p>
